<!-- Description:

We need to develop a web application that maintains information of different companies and users in the relational database. Design & implement this application and demonstrate the functionality.

Following is the list of functionalities that we need to implement in this application:

1. Add a Company [Name, City]

2. Add a User [Name, Email, Phone]

3. Allocate a User to one or more Companies

4. List Users [Name, Email, Phone, Allocated Companies (comma separated string)]

5. Delete a given Company

6. Get a User’s data for a given Company

Notes:

· Implement backend for this web application that provides RESTful APIs.

· Assume a suitable authentication mechanism but no need to implement it now.

· Instead of implementing API for #1 and #2, you can populate this data in database manually.

· It is must to implement #3 and #5 as APIs.

· If possible, you can also implement API for #4 and #6.

Technologies:

· Any Java framework like Spring MVC, Spring Boot, etc.

· MySQL

· RESTful API -->
